# StarGame
jQuery &amp; Timers

My first attempt and most of my time was spent trying to turn in something really cool.

I failed to do it. The only way I could think of to do it - and the only way my husband really wanted me to try to do it - was a way we haven't yet learned in class. He offered to try to teach me and/or write some of it himself in the short time I had remaining, but I declined. I'm turning this in as Star Game because I feel like it's where most of my homework effort went these past couple of days. I also still feel like it's pretty cool and you can still kind of see what I was intending from what I have done.

Someday I'd love to have this fixed up and made properly. Someday.
